# Minimal React Router Example

Demonstration of a left navigation menu with React Router.

No server, no build, just React Router on your browser.

# Try it locally

Start up an http server and navigate to index.html

With Node:
- `npm install http-server`
- `node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server`
- Open a browser to `localhost:8080`

# Notes

As this is a minimal example, all dependencies (babel, react) are specified in the index.html

As of Jan 7 2019, there is not yet support for ES Modules for babel-standalone or in Google Chrome.  Use create-react-app if you will be using dependencies.
